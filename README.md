# Data-Analysis-and-prediciton-of-COVID-19-cases

From the study, we conclude that numbers of COVID- 19 Confirmed cases are increasing rapidly. The idea behind this work is to make predictions about the numbers of cases in the near future.By collecting knowledge about machine learning, predictive methods used in the past, and previous studies specific to COVID-19, we use machine learning predictive methods to register COVID-19 cases in respected regions. You can build a system  to predict trends  that will get registered in the respective local body. Analysts can use two ML algorithms, long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated regression unit (GRU), to make comparisons and use better algorithms to make predictions. The model helps to better understand the effect of COVID-19 in India. The strengthening of local governments indirectly contributes to the  strengthening of the country and supports the preparation of the medical and administrative sectors.
